INTRODUCTION

The software SESEuPy has been developed by the research group Computational
Engineering and Automation (CEA) at Wismar University of Applied Sciences.
The software implements an Execution Unit according to the System Entity
Structure / Model Base (SES/MB) infrastructure introduced for automatic
execution of simulation experiments.
Please read the documentation for further information. A comprehensive
introduction to the SES/MB theory is given in the documentation of the SES
modeling tool SESToPy.
The software is written in Python3.

EXECUTE

The program can be executed from source. Python3 needs to be installed and the
program can be started with the command:
- in Windows: python main.py
- in Linux: python3 main.py

Versions built for Windows or Linux have an executable with the name "SESEuPy"
in the program directory.
